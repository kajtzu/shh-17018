Exercise for SHH course 17018

A brute force nonce finder for the extra credit exercise in class 17018

WARNING: YOU SHOULD NOT BLINDLY RUN A SNIPPET FROM GITHUB OR PASTEBIN.COM ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER UNLESS YOU TRUST THE SOURCE.

The script is self-contained, it has no external library dependencies beyond nodejs. I used nodejs v 6.17.1 but I would assume any later version will work.


Instructions:

- you will need to install nodejs
- figure out how many leading zeros you need (I would suggest starting low)
- fill in the variable named data correctly
- wait


Any faster or more efficient ways of doing this are left as an exercise to the reader.
